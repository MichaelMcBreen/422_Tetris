1. Keyboard input
	The current keyboard input uses a debouncer for much of the code so sending
	a single key press is not recognized and I have not found a way to simulate
	a key hold for enough time. The other issue is the game time update settings
	the way it is implemented the game needs to be running for the menu to be
	updated, this should be changed as to not depend on things above it.

	Update- Tke keyboard interupt class depends on the use of Keyboard state and game time both of which are part of XNA and we can not see.
	To get around this I wrote a test function into keyboard input that allows us to set a keyboard state however it does not change what keys are pressed on the keyboard (this is a bit confusing but i can set the keyboard state of the input class but if KeyboardState newState = Keyboard.GetState(); is called is will return what keys are pressed on the physical keyboard).

	Also the menu update grabs phyical keyboard so i wrote a test function without that logic.
