1. Keyboard input
	The current keyboard input uses a debouncer for much of the code so sending
	a single key press is not recognized and I have not found a way to simulate
	a key hold for enough time. The other issue is the game time update settings
	the way it is implemented the game needs to be running for the menu to be
	updated, this should be changed as to not depend on things above it.
